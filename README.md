# Interactions-in-Regression-Fixed-Effects-in-Regression-and-Logistic-Regression

Using the sales.csv, written the code to show effects of interactions, if any, on the linear regression model to predict the total_sales for a new area using given sales from three areas. Develop a full Logistic Regression Model using customer.csv whether the customer will purchase the product or not. Also, trained trimmed logistic regression models (Trimmed over features in the data). Computed the "in-sample R2" (pseudo) for the models trained and compared the models based on this metric.
For the Logistic Regression models trained above, picked the best model wrt to the in-sample R2 and interpreted model’s coefficients (For example, what effect does a positive or negative coefficient have on the model and so on).
Plotted the interactions of the ‘Age’ and ‘Gender’ features with the ‘Purchased’ output.
